<b>2020-09-28 (Publication)</b>: Authors of FedML (https://fedml.ai) have 7 papers that got accepted to NeurIPS 2020. Big congratulations!!!
Here is the publication list: https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/blob/master/publications.md. Highlighted ones are related to large-scale distributed learning and federated learning.


## What is Federated Learning?
Please read this long vision paper [Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04977).

## Introduction
Federated learning is a rapidly growing research field in the machine learning domain. 
Although considerable research efforts have been made, existing libraries cannot adequately support diverse algorithmic development (e.g., diverse topology and flexible message exchange), 
and inconsistent dataset and model usage in experiments make fair comparisons difficult.
In this work, we introduce FedML, an open research library and benchmark that facilitates the development of new federated learning algorithms and fair performance comparisons. 
FedML supports three computing paradigms (distributed training, mobile on-device training, and standalone simulation) for users to conduct experiments in different system environments. 
FedML also promotes diverse algorithmic research with flexible and generic API design and reference baseline implementations. A curated and comprehensive benchmark dataset for the non-I.I.D setting aims at making a fair comparison.
We believe FedML can provide an efficient and reproducible means of developing and evaluating algorithms for the federated learning research community. We maintain the source code, documents, and user community at https://FedML.ai.

## Usage
1. Research on FL algorithm or system
2. Teaching in a ML course
3. System prototype for industrial production.
4. Self-study FL: understanding code level details of FL algorithms.

## Architecture

<img src="./docs/image/fedml.jpg" width="620">


The functionality of each package is as follows:

**fedml_core**: The FedML low level API package. This package implements distributed computing by communication backend like MPI, and also support topology management. 
Other low-level APIs related to security and privacy are also supported.

**fedml_api**: The FedML high level API package. This package support different federated learning algorithm with only one line code.
All algorithms are built based on the "fedml_core" package.
Users can change this package to add more advanced algorithms.


**fedml_experiments**: This package is used to test algorithms in "fedml" package by calling high level APIs.

**fedml_mobile**: This package is used to support on-device training using Android/iOS smartphones. 

**fedml_IoT**: This package is used to support on-device training using IoT devices. 

**applications**: This package is a collection of applications based on FedML.

**benchmark**: This package is used to run benchmark experiments.
